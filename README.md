# Angular State Manager

This project is to test and compare different libraries and methods for handling Angular state.

There is a route for each technique. They all are based on a simple User model. All techniques use a User CRUD and have an isolated component that displays a list of users.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To consume the Back service, install [Mockoon]('https://mockoon.com/') and run the demo API that comes with it.
